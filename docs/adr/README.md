# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Starter application.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Template

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue we're facing?
- **Decision**: What did we decide?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?
